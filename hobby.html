            Badminton is one of my favorite hobby. 
            Badminton is a very easy game, all people can play it,children,student,parent,and oldman can play it. 
            Badminton is a game who are played by one, or double, or mix (men and women). Now, many people like badminton. 
            In the world there are many profesional player, like Lin Dan, Taufik Hidayat, and Alan Budikusuma who are the best player in the world championship. That's why I play it. I want to be like him.
